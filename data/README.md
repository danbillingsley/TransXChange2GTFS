# Setting up the data directory

The data directory contains the input, output and config for the tool.

* input should contain the Traveline XML files that you want to process. You can get the Traveline files from the [Traveline page on the Gov.uk data portal][TRAVELINE]
* output will hold the text outputs. A zipped version of this will be created

You will also need a recent Stops.zip file. You can download the Stops csv file from the [NaPTAN page on the Gov.UK data portal][NAPTAN].
